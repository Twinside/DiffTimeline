If you\r\nclick the huge button `<`, you can fetch previous commit from the\r\ncurrent head\r\n\r\n![Fetching previous commits](tutorial/fetch_previous_commit.png)\r\n\r\nIf you click the button above `<` you can switch back and forth to the\r\n\"compact\" view.\r\n\r\n![Compact commit view](tutorial/compact_commit.png)\r\n\r\nNavigating files\r\n----------------\r\nClicking on the `Tree` panel will show you all the files contained\r\nin the commit and let you browse them.\r\n\r\n![Commit tree](tutorial/commit_tree.png)\r\n\r\nYou can click on any to follow the history of a specific file, let's follow the `static-content/difftimeline.css`\r\n\r\n![File diff](tutorial/file_diff.png)\r\n\r\nYou can see every modification of a file between two commits. In the commit description, each round represent a commit whom have not modified the file. If you click on any round, you will jump to the commit description. You can also use the compact mode\r\n\r\n![File diff](tutorial/file_diff_compact.png)\r\n\r\nTo directly see modifications for a file, you can use `$ difftimeline filename` at the command line.\r\n\r\n\r\nComparing branches\r\n------------------\r\nThis part is still 'experimental', so expect changes in the future, and there is still rough edges. To let you compare branch, launch difftimeline the following way : `difftimeline compare`\r\n\r\n![Branch comparaison](tutorial/branch_compare.png)\r\n\r\nYou can then drag'n'drop branches in the square to compare them\r\n\r\n![Branch comparaison](tutorial/branch_compare_result.png)\r\n\r\nModification\r\n------------\r\nTo modify/hack difftimeline, see the [Building.md](Building.md) file.\r\n","name":"Difftimeline"}
